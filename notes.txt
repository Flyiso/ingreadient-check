TO-DO's, ideas to test, thoughts, and other stuff to remember/keep track of.

Algorithms to test-
Get input frame.
    check distance(in number of frames) since last frame merged to panorama(if any)
    if distance great enough, continue with these steps(and break if any fails):
        check if image is sharp enough
        check if image is different enough(from last approved to panorama(if any))
        extract label area from frame
        use RANSAC regressor to 'smoothen' the extracted label boundaries
        use smoothed label shape to create values for re-shaping maps.
        re-shape image to adjust/correct for perspective & (possibly)tilt
        try to stitch image to the panorama(or add as base/first img if none yet.)

        if stitching(or add first) succeed:
            modify the threshold for difference between frames
            !# modify interval between checked frames?
            !# use tesseract when evaluation of success/modificaton of diff&interval?
            !# process/evaluate panorama result?
            set the last stitched frame index to current index
            START OVER WITH NEXT FRAME(current index+interval)
        else:
            modify threshold of frame difference(lower it)
            !# modify frame interval?
            CONTINUE/RESTART WITH NEXT FRAME(current index+1)
